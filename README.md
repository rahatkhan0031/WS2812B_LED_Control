# ðŸŒˆ WS2812B RGB LED Control with FastLED

This project demonstrates how to control WS2812B RGB LED strips using the **FastLED** library for Arduino.

---

## ðŸ›  Components
- Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega
- WS2812B RGB LED strip
- 5V power supply (capable of handling LED current draw)
- 330Î© resistor (between Arduino pin and LED data pin)
- 1000ÂµF capacitor (across 5V and GND at LED power input)
- Jumper wires

---

## ðŸ’¡ Functionality
- Uses the **FastLED** library for easy control of WS2812B LEDs.
- Demonstrates various color animations and effects.
- Adjustable brightness and speed.

## ðŸ“· Wiring Diagram
*(Add image once uploaded)*  
Typical connection:
- Arduino pin **D6** â†’ LED strip **Data In** (with 330Î© resistor in series)
- LED strip **+5V** â†’ 5V power supply
- LED strip **GND** â†’ Arduino GND and power supply GND

---

## â–¶ How to Run
1. Install the **FastLED** library in Arduino IDE (Sketch â†’ Include Library â†’ Manage Libraries â†’ Search "FastLED")
2. Wire the WS2812B LEDs according to the diagram above.
3. Upload the `.ino` file to your Arduino.
4. Power the LED strip.
5. Enjoy colorful effects!
